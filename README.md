**A**s you open your eyes, you're met with an unfamiliar place. Your nose crying for help from a nearby pungent smell of the rotting corpse, and ears bleed from screeching cries echoing through the desolate place. 

You're in hell with no point of return. Next to you is your trusty rifle. 
Your time has come, so have the monsters... But you decide to die in style! The question is, for how long can you survive?

###### About the game:

Hellpoint was and is one of the most significant ventures into learning game development & programming. I went out of my comfort zone and did things I initially didn't know how to do. It was a tremendous learning experience working on this small and terrible looking game. 


While she's not perfect, she taught me a lot. I know there could be so much done with this game, e.g., add particles, variety of weapons, etc. However, such a venture was still outside (and slightly is.) my knowledge. Perhaps one day, I will get to re-create this game.


A massive thank you to Xenobrain for his enormous assistance and Love2D community.
